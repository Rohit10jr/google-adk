# Google ADK Multi Tool Agent

This project demonstrates a simple agent using the Google ADK (Agent Development Kit) in Python. The agent can answer questions about the current weather and time in a specified city (currently, only New York is supported as an example).

## Features
- Retrieve the current weather for a city
- Get the current time in a city
- Example agent setup using `google.adk.agents.Agent`

## Usage
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Review and run the code in `multi_tool_agent/agent.py` to see how the agent and its tools are defined.

## File Structure
- `multi_tool_agent/agent.py`: Main agent and tool definitions
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies
- `readme.md`: Project documentation

## Notes
- This is a practice project for learning Google ADK agent development.
- Extend the agent by adding more tools or supporting more cities as needed.
